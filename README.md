# why-N-how
Here we elaborate on numerous questions that we try to answer by asking 'why?' and 'how?' to that question

For e.g. One might wonder and say how does a my table light shines? We can answer by simply saying the light has led's(if LED) which produces the light using the electricity and which is why we say that the light is shining? Many people might be satisfied with the answer, but few might still wonder and say how does LED takes electricity and creates the light? now we are in the game. Someone might answer that question by simply saying that the LED is type of diode that takes in some voltage and glows, but is that enough? No, for some people that is not enough and they will ask why does the LED is only diode that can do that and not other diodes? or what is voltage? or why does it glows does? this can go on and on, but seriously how far can it get? Is there an end to these chain of questions that we can form? Can we come to an end where we can say that this is the end? Might not! But this is the thrill of asking questions and finding the answers, so we should start by doing so! Not worrying about learning something new or studying something for sake of some other thing, nope it is a pleasure of thinking but with asking the questions(but not limited to) 'why' and 'how'!
